#Objective
The objective of the url_shortener is to be a clone of [Bitly](https://bitly.com/). The **learning objective** of the assignment was to learn how to show specific information to users, only if they give consent.

#Features
 - A user can create a new account, and will login and logout of the site.
 - A user is allowed to shorten a url to be easier to read (as well as shorter).
 - In order to shorten a url, a user must:
  * Give the title of the page
  * Give the url of the page
  * Give an optional description of the page
  * Make the new url Public or Private
 - A user can update a new url, only if they are the one who created it.
 - If the new url was marked as public, everyone who visits the site can see the new url.
 - If the new url was marked as private, only that user can see the new url.
